### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at the [Institute of Anatomy](https://www.ana.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) of the University of Bern in Switzerland. Mostly on image processing tomographic data, trying to extract meaningful numbers from images.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new tricks with Python (in [Jupyter](https://github.com/search?l=Jupyter+Notebook&q=user%3Ahabi+notebook&type=Code)), nearly every day.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to visualizing tomographic data (or check out my work-related blog: https://micro.tomo.graphics). You can also check out my private blog: https://habi.gna.ch/).
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at [@habi:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@habi:matrix.org
) or via [email](mailto:github@davidhaberthuer.ch).
