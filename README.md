### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on image processing tomographic data, collecting numbers from images.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new tricks with Python (in [Jupyter](https://github.com/search?l=Jupyter+Notebook&q=user%3Ahabi+notebook&type=Code)), nearly every day.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to visualizing tomographic data (or check out my work blog: https://micro.tomo.graphics). You can also check out my [private blog](http://habi.gna.ch/)).
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at [@habi:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@habi:matrix.org
) or via [email](mailto:github@davidhaberthuer.ch).
